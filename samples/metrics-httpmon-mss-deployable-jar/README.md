Please see [Metrics and HTTP Monitoring Executable Jar Sample](../metrics-httpmon-mss-lite) for configuring WSO2 Data Analytics Server (DAS) and using annotations.

See also [Metrics and HTTP Monitoring MSS Bundle Sample](../metrics-httpmon-mss-bundle).


## How to build the sample

```

## How to run the sample



Unzip WSO2 MSS product and navigate to the bin directory. Then run the following command to start the MSS server.
```
