This is the WSO2 Microservices Server Hello World sample

## How to build the sample

mvn clean install
```

## How to run the sample

## How to test the sample

We will use the cURL command line tool for testing. You could use any appropriate HTTP or REST client too.

```
curl -v http://localhost:8080/hello/wso2
```

You should get a response similar to the following:

```
