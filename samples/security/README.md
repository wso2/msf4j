# Security Sample

This sample shows how to secure microservices deployed on WSO2 MSS using OAuth2.

## Setting up the Authorization Server.

Here we use WSO2 Identity server as the authorization server.

1) Download and unzip the latest version of the WSO2 Identity Server from http://wso2.com/products/identity-server.

2) Copy resources/introspect.war to wso2is-5.1.0/repository/deployment/server/webapps directory.

3) Create a Service Provider by following the instructions in the this document
 [https://docs.wso2.com/display/IS510/Configuring+a+Service+Provider]
 (https://docs.wso2.com/display/IS510/Configuring+a+Service+Provider)

4) Then under the "configure inbound authentication" section, create an OAuth2 application which represents your
client application. Instructions are available in the above documentation link. Once the OAuth2 application is created,
you will get a pair of keys called OAuth Client Key and OAuth Client Secret.

5) Execute following command from the installation directory to start the server.  e.g. /home/user/wso2is-5.1.0/

 ```
 sh bin/wso2server.sh
 ```

6) Execute the following command using OAuth Client Key and OAuth Client Secret.
This command should return with a JSON response which contains the access token.

 ```
 curl -v -k -X POST --basic -u <OAuth Client Key>:<OAuth Client Secret> -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8" -d "grant_type=client_credentials" https://localhost:9443/oauth2/token
 ```

 ```
 {"access_token":"ded91567bbc7573d5c47e77e700f62ac","token_type":"Bearer","expires_in":3600}
 ```

Note the access_token value.

## How to build the sample

From this directory, run

```
mvn clean install
```

## How to run the sample

When you start the MSS server, you need to pass a system property with the endpoint of the authorization server.

e.g. AUTH_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:9763/introspect

If the system property is not specified, then a default value of "http://localhost:9763/introspect" will be set in this
 sample

Use following command to run the application

```
java -DAUTH_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:9763/introspect -jar target/security-*.jar
```

## How to tests the sample

Use following cURL commands.

```
curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>" http://localhost:8080/hello/john

> GET /hello/sameera HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8080
> User-Agent: curl/7.43.0
> Accept: */*
> Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
>
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Type: */*
< Content-Length: 13
< Connection: keep-alive

Hello john

```
