#WSO2 Microservices Server (MSS)

WSO2 Microservices Server is a lightweight high performance runtime for hosting microservices.

WSO2 MSS is one of the highest performing lightweight microservices frameworks. The following graphs show the 
throughput & memory consumption characteristics of MSS against other microservies frameworks.

##Getting Started

It is really easy to define & deploy a microservice using WSO2 Microservices Server. 
You simply need to annotate your service and deploy it using a single line of code. 
Check the following [Hello-Service]
(samples/helloworld) sample.

####pom.xml
This pom file inherits from mss-lite-parent/pom.xml. It provides a way of setting up things quickly with minimum 
amount of 
configuration. [More info](mss-lite-parent).

```xml
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">

    <parent>
        <artifactId>mss-lite-parent</artifactId>
        <groupId>org.wso2.carbon.mss</groupId>
        <version>1.0.0</version>
        <relativePath>../../mss-lite-parent/pom.xml</relativePath>
    </parent>
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

    <groupId>org.wso2.carbon.mss.sample</groupId>
    <artifactId>Hello-Service</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>

    <name>Hello Microservice Sample</name>

    <properties>
        <microservice.mainClass>org.wso2.carbon.mss.example.Application</microservice.mainClass>
    </properties>

</project>
```

####HelloService.java
This is the hello service implementation that uses JAX-RS annotations.
```java
@Path("/hello")
public class HelloService {

    @GET
    @Path("/{name}")
    public String hello(@PathParam("name") String name) {
        return "Hello " + name;
    }

}
```


####Application.java
This is the one-liner to deploy your service using WSO2 Microservices Server.
```java
public class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new MicroservicesRunner()
                .deploy(new HelloService())
                .start();
    }
}
```


###Build the Service
Run following Maven command. This will create the uber jar **Hello-Service-1.0.0.jar** in **target** directory.
```
mvn package
```


###Run the Service
You just have to run the following command to get your service up and running.
```
java -jar target/Hello-Service-1.0.0.jar
```


###Test the Service with curl
Run the following command or simply go to [http://localhost:8080/hello/Microservices]
(http://localhost:8080/hello/Microservices) 
from your browser.
```
curl http://localhost:8080/hello/Microservices
```


##Supported Annotations

For defining services, we support a subset of the JAXRS annotations.

###Class level annotations
#####@Path
Root path for resource methods. All the paths specified in the resource methods will be sub paths of this.

#####@Consumes
Default consume media type(s) for resource methods. The resource methods that do not specify @Consume annotation will
 inherit this consume media type(s).

#####@Produces
Default produce media type(s) for resource methods. The resource methods that do not specify @Produce annotation will
inherit this produce media type(s).


###Method level annotations
#####@Path
Endpoint of the resource method relative to @Path of the container resource class.

#####@Consumes
Media type(s) that the method can consume. This overrides the class level @Consumes media types.

#####@Produces
Media type(s) that is produced by the method. This overrides the class level @Produces media types.

#####@GET
HTTP GET method. Specify that the resource method supports HTTP GET method.

#####@PUT
HTTP PUT method. Specify that the resource method supports HTTP PUT method.

#####@POST
HTTP POST method. Specify that the resource method supports HTTP POST method.

#####@DELETE
HTTP DELETE method. Specify that the resource method supports HTTP DELETE method.


###Parameter level annotations
#####@DefaultValue
Specify a default value for a resource method parameter. The value will be automatically converted to the 
corresponding parameter's type.

#####@Context
Inject additional objects to a resource method. Currently supports injection of  following objects.
* org.wso2.carbon.mss.HttpStreamHandler - 
    This object can be used to stream a chunked request body and process it while the request is streaming. 
* io.netty.handler.codec.http.HttpRequest - 
    This object can be used to retrieve HTTP request information. [More info](http://netty.io/4.0/api/io/netty/handler/codec/http/HttpRequest.html).
* org.wso2.carbon.mss.HttpResponder - 
    This object can be used to send HTTP responses. You can make responses more clean way by returning an instance of 
    javax.ws.rs.core.Response or a POJO. See the [StockQuote-Service]
    (https://github.com/wso2/product-mss/tree/master/samples/stockquote-service) sample.

#####@PathParam
/StockQuote/{symbol} to get value of symbol. The value will be automatically converted to the corresponding parameter
 type and assigned to that parameter.

#####@QueryParam
/Students?age=18 to get value of age. The value will be automatically converted to the corresponding parameter type 
and assigned to that parameter.

#####@HeaderParam
To read HTTP request header values. The value will be automatically converted to the corresponding parameter type and
 assigned to that parameter.




###Lifecycle Callback Methods
Support following Java lifecycle callback method annotations. 

#####@PostConstruct
Invoke by the container on newly constructed service instances after all dependency injection has completed and before transport starts. 

#####@PreDestroy
Invoke by the container during server shutdown before the  container removes the service instance.

For detailed example refer lifecycle sample from [here](https://github.com/wso2/product-mss/tree/master/samples/lifecycle).
